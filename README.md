# Closest-Pair-of-Points
Algorithms Course Homework 1

 * Classical problem for divide and conquer algorithms. From n number of points with x-y coordinates find the two points that are the closest to each other.
 * Algorithm developed by me using C.
 * A couple of features added to the homework spesifications.
  * Selection of two input methods that are firstly randomly generated points and secondly user given points by standart input device.
  * Time comparison of brute force method with my algorithm.
